Summary
-------
JMetro is a board game based on Metro a board game designed by Dirk Henn. 
The game starts with an empty square board. Each player has metro stations
in their own color at the edges of the board. They try to make the metro 
lines that start at their stations as long as possible. Each square that
the line visits is one point, and the points of a line double if the line
ends in the center of the board. Each turn each player can place one card. 
The player can use this card to extend its own lines, or to shorten the 
opponents lines. However, lines of only one tile are not allowed, unless 
there are no other places to place your card. The game ends when the board
is filled.
